## About The Project

In this web application, you can record your workouts, whether you ran or cycled. When opened, it asks for location to display your current location. By tapping on the map, you can add the training location and then enter the information.
By clicking on each item in the list, you will jump to the location marked on the map.
All your individual workouts are saved locally, so when the website is updated or reopened, the previous exercises are loaded again.

## Built in

1. HTML5
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Leaflet library

## What I learned

I learned a lot about using libraries and that they have almost endless possibilities. I found it exciting to create classes and to inherit through the class, as well as to save and restore local data.

## Acknowledgment

Thanks to everyone who gives feedback on my solution. It definitely helps you find new ways to code and find easier solutions!
